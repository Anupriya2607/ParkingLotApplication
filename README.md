## Architecture & Design

This project follows a modular, clean architecture. The major layers/components include:

- **Models / Domain** — Entities like `ParkingLot`, `Slot`, `Vehicle`, etc.  
- **Service / Core Logic** — Algorithms for allocation, deallocation, searching spots.  
- **Adapters / Interface** — Input / output handlers (CLI, REST, etc.).  
- **Persistence** — (If applicable) storage or in‑memory maps.  

You may follow Dependency Injection, SOLID principles and keep your modules loosely coupled.
